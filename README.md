# CoreHook

A library to hook unmanaged applications by hosting .NET Core and running managed code to extend an application's functionality (more information [here](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/docs/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting.md)).  

Inspired and based on the great [EasyHook](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook) library.


Still in development and a lot might be broken. Pull requests/contributions are all welcome!
